<h1><u>ABOUT ME:</u></h1>
<p>Pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communications Engineering at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology, I'm a passionate and innovative multidisciplinary professional with interests spanning across game development, UI/UX design, digital marketing, and AI interactions. I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to projects that blend these realms and create impactful experiences for users.

  As an aspiring game developer, I'm proficient in Unity Engine and have a flair for creativity and immersive storytelling. I have worked on several game projects, such as a 3D platformer, a horror game, and a puzzle game, using Figma to create intuitive and visually appealing user interfaces. As a digital marketing enthusiast, I'm skilled in leveraging online platforms, such as Instagram, Twitter, and Medium, to drive engagement, boost brand visibility, and create meaningful connections. As a chatGPT API aficionado, I'm fascinated by the world of AI and prompt engineering. I'm working on building dynamic and engaging conversational models that redefine user interactions, using Python and chatGPT API. With a creative edge, I bring my passion for graphical design to the forefront. I have an eye for aesthetics and attention to detail, and I can craft visually stunning assets using Adobe Photoshop that resonate with audiences.
  
  My journey has just begun, and I'm excited to collaborate, learn, and grow within dynamic and forward-thinking teams. I'm open to exploring synergies and possibilities in the realms of game development, UI/UX design, digital marketing, AI interactions, and graphical design.
